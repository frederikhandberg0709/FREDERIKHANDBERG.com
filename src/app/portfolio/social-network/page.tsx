            BLOP is a social network I created as a portfolio project, designed
            to closely mirror the functionality of modern social media
            platforms. My goal was to make it as realistic and feature-rich as
            possible, providing users with an experience they would expect from
            today&apos;s social networks.

                Frontend & API (Next.js)
              </h3>
              <p>
                The frontend was built using Next.js. There are two main reasons
                for why I chose Next.js. First of all, it&apos;s a fullstack
                framework that makes it easy for a small team (in my case, just
                me), to work quickly and efficiently since it comes with most of
                the necessary tools out of the box. Secondly, the React
                documentations specifically recommend using Next.js.
                <br />
                <br />
                Instead of setting up a separate server (such as Express or
                Spring Boot), Next.js lets me build a REST server directly in
                the same project by using API routes.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <h3 className="mt-2.5 text-xl font-bold">
                Notification Service (Express.js)
              </h3>
              <p>
                I mentioned earlier that one of the advantages of Next.js is
                that you might not need a separate server since it provides API
                routes. I did use API routes for all my HTTP calls.
                <br />
                <br />
                However, I wanted a notification service using Socket.IO.
                Technically, I could have built it directly in Next.js, but that
                would mean I couldn&apos;t use the default Next.js server â€“ I
                would have to set up my own custom server in Next.js instead.
                Because of this, I decided it was better to have a separate
                Express.js server for the notification service.
                <br />
                <br />I chose Socket.IO mainly because I already have experience
                with SignalR from my third-semester project, and since Socket.IO
                is very similar to SignalR, it seemed like the obvious choice.

            <h2 className="text-xl font-bold">Project Features</h2>
            <p>
              I have tried implementing the features that people expect from a
              modern social network. This includes the basic features such as
              being able to like and comment on posts, but also more advanced
              features, such as being able to switch accounts.

              <p className="font-bold">User Authentication</p>
              <p>
                I used NextAuth to build the authentication system, allowing
                users to log in with either their email or username and a
                password. For security, passwords are hashed using Argon2 before
                being stored in the database.
              </p>

                width={1000}
                height={500}
                className="h-auto w-full rounded-2xl"

            <div className="space-y-2.5">
              <p className="font-bold">Reset Password</p>
              <p>
                The reset password functionality ensures that users can update
                their passwords if they forget it. Before submitting, the form
                performs validation checks:
                <ul className="ml-5 list-disc">
                  <li>If the new password meets security requirements</li>
                  <li>If the confirmation password matches the new password</li>
                </ul>
                If the validation passes, the request is sent to the API with
                the identifier (email or username) and the new password.
                <br />
                <br />
                On the backend, in the API route, it searches for a user
                matching the provided identifier. If no user is found, it will
                return a &quot;User not found&quot; error.
                <br />
                <br />
                If the user exists:
                <ul className="ml-5 list-disc">
                  <li>The new password is securely hashed using</li>
                  Argon2.
                  <li>
                    The hashed password is stored in the database, replacing
                  </li>
                  the old one.
                  <li>A success response is sent back.</li>
                </ul>
                <br />
                <br />
                In a real-world application, password resets should be handled
                more securely. Instead of allowing users to reset their password
                directly by providing their email or username, the system should
                send a reset link to the user&apos; email with a token.

          <div>
            <h2 className="text-xl font-bold">Future Development</h2>
            <p className="font-bold">Search functionality</p>
            <p>
              There is currently a search input on the web application, but this
              is not functional. Users should be able to search for posts by
              keywords and hashtags, and to search for other users either by
              their profile name or username.
              <br />
              <br />
              It should not be too difficult to implement this feature. I think
              one approach to implement this feature is by using URL params with
              the user&apos;s search input, then querying the database for posts
              or users that match the search input.
              <br />
              <br />
              However, the way I have set up the search input as of now, I would
              like the search results to update live as the user types. For
              this, the URL params approach would not be ideal.
              <br />
              <br />
              The search functionality could be implemented client-side where
              the search results update in real-time as the user types, rather
              than using URL parameters.
              <br />
              <br />
              First of all, I should make sure to prevent excessive API calls as
              the user types. A small delay of about 300ms after the user has
              stopped typing could be made before sending the request to the
              API.
              <br />
              I already use React Query for data fetching, so I should just
              continue using that for the search functionality as well. It gives
              me caching and state management capabilities to handle search
              requests. This provides automatic loading states, error handling,
              and data caching.
              <br />
              <br />
              Lastly, I will need to create a dedicated API route for searching
              posts and users, with filtering logic based on the search term.
