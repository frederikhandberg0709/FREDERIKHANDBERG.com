      <p>
        Hello, my name is Frederik Handberg and I am 22 years old. I am born and
        raised in Horsens, in a family of five.
        <br />
        <br />
        Since a young age, I have always been interested in technology and
        electronics. Naturally, I started gaining an interest in coding (simple
        Hello World websites in HTML and CSS), which later evolved into
        programming in JavaScript to make my little websites interactive.
        <br />
        In 2023, I began studying for a degree in Software Engineering at VIA
        Horsens. I am now doing my 4th semester.
        <br />
        <br />
        In my spare time, I like to work on my own projects like my social
        network. Of course, I don&apos;t code all the time. But when I
        don&apos;t, I usually still do something related to technology. Whether
        that&apos;s to build and fly drones, or make small diecast models of
        police vehicles with emergency lighting. This usually involves some
        programming of Arduino microcontrollers, to make the flash patterns. And
        sometimes, I also like to play video games, mostly Dirt Rally 2.0 and
        WRC 24 (I am a big rally-fan!)
